# Material theme for Shower [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/shower/material.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/shower/material)

![Ribbon screen shot](pictures/canvas.png)

Default theme for the [Shower](https://github.com/shower/shower/) presentation engine. Doesn’t include engine itself. [See it in action](http://shwr.me/shower/themes/material/). Follow [@shower_me](https://twitter.com/shower_me) for support and updates, [file an issue](https://github.com/shower/shower/issues/new) if you have any.

## Usage

Get the Shower template where Material is already included. Download the [template archive](http://shwr.me/shower.zip) or install the package:

	npm install shower

If you want to install Material separately you can download the [theme archive](http://shwr.me/material.zip) or install the package:

	npm install shower-material

## Features

All theme’s features are demonstrated in the [index.html](index.html) file. Use it as a reference while building your presentation. See more detailed [features overview](https://github.com/shower/shower/blob/master/docs/features-en.md).

## Ratios

Material theme supports two slide ratios: wide 16×10 (default) and taller 4×3. To change the slide’s ratio include one of the pre-built `screen-16x10.css` or `screen-4x3.css` files in the `<head>` of your presentation.

## PDF

Ribbon could be exported to PDF by printing it from the list mode in Chrome or Opera browsers. See [printing documentation](https://github.com/shower/shower/blob/master/docs/printing-en.md) for more options.
